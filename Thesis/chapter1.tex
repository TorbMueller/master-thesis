\section{MEMS and IMUs}
Mircro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have found many types of applications in fields such as consumer electronics \parencite{shah2019design}, 
manufacturing \parencite{buajenescu2019mems}, or automotive \parencite{jin2021applications} since their emergence roughly 30 years ago \parencite{Gabriel1988}.
MEMS based Inertia Measurement Units (IMUs) can be used as Acceleromets, Gyroscopes and Magnetometers and
